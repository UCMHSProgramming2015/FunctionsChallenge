# Name: Work()

## Examples:
println(Work(250,15));

## Description:
This physics function for work will find the value of Work given the values of Force (F) and distance (d). The F and d are multiplied to give the output value of F. 

## Syntax:
Work(F,d)

##Parameters: 
float F: the amount of Force it take to do a cetain work 
float d: the distance the Force moves

##Returns:
the amount of Work.
