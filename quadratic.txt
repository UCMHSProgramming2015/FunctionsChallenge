# Name: float [] quadratic

## Examples:
float[] quadratic(float a, float b, float c) {
  float[] answers = new float[2];
  answers[0]=(-b + sqrt( b*b - 4*a*c)) / (2*a);
  answers[1]=(-b - sqrt( b*b - 4*a*c)) / (2*a);
  return answers;

## Description:
the function was created to calculate the zeros of the equation, chosen by user, by using the
quadratic formula. it is an array, since the formula will provide two answers.
the function is a float, since it will return a value, and then set up with three float parameters

## Syntax:
datatype[]var( float var, float var, float var){
	datatype[]var= new datatype[n];
	var[n]=value;
	return var;

##Parameters: 
float a,b,c= according to equation chosen by user in void draw 
these are the coefficients in the quadratic formula, and also serve as the variables 
in the function 

##Returns:
the zeros of the equation (value)
