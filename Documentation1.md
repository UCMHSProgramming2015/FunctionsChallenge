# Name: KineticEnergy

## Examples:
Find the kinetic energy of a 100 kilogram boulder flying at 10 meters per second ignoring air resistance.
Kinetic energy= one half mass* velocity squared 
k=m*SQ(vx)/2
k=100*sq(10)/2
k=10,000/2
k=5,000

Find the kinetic energy of a 100 kilogram boulder flying at that moves 10 meters.
Kinetic energy= one half mass* velocity squared 
k=m*SQ(vx)/2
k=100*sq(10)/2
k=10,000/2
k=5,000

## Description:
Using mass and velocity/distance finds the kinetic energy through the physics equation.

## Syntax:
A physics equation for kinetic energy.
