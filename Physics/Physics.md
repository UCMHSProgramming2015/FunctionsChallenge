# Name: 
Physics - Kinematic Equation Solver

## Examples:
```
 vf = kinematic(vo, a, d);
```

## Description:
The program calculates the final velocity based on the given acceleration, initial velocity, and distance.

## Syntax:
```processing
float kinematic(float vo, float a, float d){
}
```
##Parameters: 
Float vo is used to set initial velocity, float a is used to set acceleration, and d is used to set distance.
The variables are declared at the top of the code to allow easy modification of values.

##Returns:
The program returns the final velocity, or the float vf. It is calculated using the equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad.


##Other notes:
