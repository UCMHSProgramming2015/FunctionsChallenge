# Name: DrawALine

## Examples:


## Description:
Visual function to draw random lines across the canvas

## Syntax:
float x
float y
float xx
float yy

##Parameters: 
x= mouseX
y= mouseY
xx=random(width)
yy=random(height)

##Returns:
There is no return value.

##Other notes:
 I thought it was interesting that the lines seem point to the center/ opposite end of the canvas. I didn't know that by settung the ending points of the line to random numbers within the canvas size, I would get that result.
