# Name:
forceStress()

## Examples:
background(0);    //this is the background wow
size(800,600);    //set the canvas size
noFill();     //no fill I mean really what did it say
stroke(255);    //line colour of white
forceStress();    //call forceStress function

## Description:
draws pretty circles
they're actually opposing pseudo-charges that I keep mentioning
(do you not see how my mind is deteriorating by the second)
it makes the circle outline the same colour as a hidden image layered under the electricity
I drew the hidden layer such that when the circle was over light colours, it'd be black,
and when it was over dark colours, it'd be white
oh and at the end it prints a secret message that you should find on the console command thing
heh heh heh
good night

## Syntax:
forceStress()

##Parameters: 
none

##Returns:
void

##Other notes:
Somewhere in my mind is the pervasive quote that Frank Herbert wrote in Dune...
but I'm too tired to remember it, and I'm listening to the new Monster Hunter Cross
soundtrack, which can be found here, obviously labelled in the video titles... (falls asleep)
