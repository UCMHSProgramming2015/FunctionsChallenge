# Name: pointslope()

## Examples:
printlm(pointslope(3,4,7)); 

## Description:
This function will give the y value for the point slope math equation, y=mx=b. The m stands for the slope, the x stands for the x coordinate, and the b stands for the y-intercept. This equation uses 3 variables to come up with the result of y for the x value plugged into the equation. This equation is linear.

## Syntax:
pointslope(m, x, b)

##Parameters: 
float m: slope of line  
float x: x coordinate of any point of the line
float b: y-intercept of the line 

##Returns:
the Y value for the X value.
