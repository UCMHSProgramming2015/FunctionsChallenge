# Functions Challenge
Your assignment, whether or not you choose to accept it, is to create three functions. One should be phyics-based, another should be math-based, and the third should
 do something visual. The other half of your assignment is to document your three functions. The three functions should be demonstrated. You may demonstrate them 
all in one Processing sketch or in up to 3 separate sketches.

# Assessment
This will be a classwork assignment with a total value of 30 points. 5 points for each function, and 5 points for each documentation.
Assessment criteria:
* Each function will be graded on quality and how challenging it is. Quality will be determined based on correct use of code, modularity of
 the function (how easy is it to reuse), and how well it accomplishes the task. Consideration will be given to how challenging your function use.
* Documentation will be graded on clarity and how well it explains the function. Please change the name of each documentation document to reflect 
the name of your function.
